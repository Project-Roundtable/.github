# Project Roundtable

## What is Project Roundtable?
Project Roundtable is a programming group created by myself Luke Skinner @LJSkinner and Andrew McGuckin @AndrewMcGuckin. We created this group in our last year of University as a way continuining to better ourselves, have fun and most importantly keep programming. However, that doesn't mean that everything we do has no purpose. We try our best to work on projects that will have an audience and benefit people in some way. We recently started our first public project which aims to deliver a website to help fellow University of Stirling Graduates calculate their degree classification. We generally keep our repositories public and with permissive licenses such as MIT, so that we can help give back in open source. 

## Can I use/reuse source code or resources from Project Roundtable resources?
Yes! Just make sure that you check the individual repositories, as although we generally use permissive licenses there may be some exceptions or additional attributions you'd need to include. If you're unsure, get in touch with Luke Skinner at the contact email.

## Want to help us out?
If you'd like to help us out, you can either go have a look at the projects we're working on and submit issues or pull requests. We always appreciate constructive criticism and provided there is enough detail, we're likely to accept contributions. If you'd like to get involved more generally, please email Luke Skinner at ljs.work@pm.me.
